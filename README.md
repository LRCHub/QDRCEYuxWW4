[00:13.19] Give me a peace sign
[00:15.52] Say cheese, 'cause this is my magic spell
[00:18.83] That makes the camera take your pictures
[00:21.39] Flash drives aways your sorrows
[00:22.96] Viewfinder shows tomorrow
[00:24.65] Will be a great day to hang out
[00:40.15] 
[00:27.20] Even if
[00:29.29] There are aways worries that you can't hide, I'm by your side
[00:59.79] 
[00:34.12] Let's change outfit
[00:35.99] Uniform's don't define who we are
[00:38.86] Let me clean up and show them who's a shining star
[00:42.22] When I try, they're surprised, at just how, well I'm doing, all this work puts me to sleep
[01:27.22] 
[00:48.52] Getting annoyed, willful, moody, stubborn, throw a temper
[00:51.62] Hey, did I scare you? (Run)
[00:53.59] It's okay if you need some space, I won't cut you off
[01:20.09] 
[00:56.37] Whenever you need me
[00:57.26] Whenever you need me
[00:58.15] Know that I'll find my way
[01:11.15] 
[00:59.32] Just like how sharks find their prey, but it will be okay
[01:27.82] 
[01:02.46] Give me a peace sign and now let me teach you yet another spell
[01:33.96] 
[01:09.31] Rock, paper, scissors
[01:10.78] No worries, don't overthink
[01:12.87] Because plans can't keep up with changes, just go with the flow
[01:16.99] Even when life is tough
[01:18.75] I'm sure we'll clean it all up, just like I do everyday-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
[01:56.75] 
[01:42.88] Rock, paper, scissors
[01:48.02] Just like I do everyday
[01:50.15] Just like I do everyday
